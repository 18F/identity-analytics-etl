Analytics Query
==============================================================================

1. Funnel view - user dropoff funnel redshift SQL statements to see where a user might be dropping off
2. Success rate - redshift success rate queries based by event name
3. User Count - IDP queries for how many users (ok for historical data, but prefer cloudwatch insights for new queries)
